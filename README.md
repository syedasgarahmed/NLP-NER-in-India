# NLP-NER-in-India


Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a vital task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that identifies and classifies named entities in text. Named entities are typically proper nouns, such as person names, organization names, and location names. NER is a challenging task for Indian languages, due to the diversity of Indian languages and the lack of resources for training NER systems. This project focuses on the comparison of four algorithms of NER techniques in the context of India. The four different algorithms are CRF (Conditional Random Fields), Stanza, Spacy, and Nameparser. The accuracy of all 4 algorithms is compared with the expected accuracy of all four methods of NER. To calculate the accuracy of four algorithms a large dataset of Indian names is used. A comparison graph was obtained to display the accuracy graph of all four algorithms.
